# TypeScript

1. Explain
   1. TypeScript at a high level
      1. TypeScript compiles dow to normal JavaScript. Users would never interact with TypeScript
      2. There's a `.ts` file for each project, generally at the organization or library level.
         1. It defines what the types are for that project - and acts as a sort of filter or linter that the TypeScript files pass through in order to compile to plain JavaScript

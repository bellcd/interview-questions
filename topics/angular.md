# Angular

1. Explain:
   1. Angular at a high level
      1. A "batteries included" style framework (as opposed to React, for example), so it includes things like routing, state management, bundler, etc...
      2. The syntax uses a JavaScript-inside-of-HTML approach (React's JSX uses an HTML-inside-of-JavaScript approach)
      3. Two way data binding (React uses one way - top down - data binding)

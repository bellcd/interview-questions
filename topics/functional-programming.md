# Functional Programming

1. What is functional programming and what are its benefits?
   1. Style of programming - programming paradigm - where the focus is on each function & its inputs / outputs
      1. Clojure, Haskell, & Lisp are set up in this way. JavaScript is multi-paradigm

|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Easier to reason about & test (because the functions are more self contained|Can be more complicated to write|
|Easier to debug|Can feel like you're jumping through a lot of hoops to maintain the functional paradigm|
|More concise||
|More scalable||
|More predictable (because the functions don't rely on external state)||

1. What are the common parts of functional programming?
   1. first class functions
      1. functions are treated the same as any other variable
   2. higher order functions
      1. functions that accept or return a function, or both (setTimeout, map, filter, reduce, etc...)
   3. Pure functions
      1. a pure function is one that when called with the same input returns the same output

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Easier to test|Not every task can be accomplished with pure functions|
|Easier to debug||
|More scalable||
|No surprises (ie, mutating the arguments / global state||
|self documenting||
|concurrency||
|cacheable||

  4. function composition
     - the concept of building more complex functions from smaller, more narrowly focused functions
     - piping (ie, sending the output of one function as the input of another function)
  5. currying
     - changing a function so that it returns a new function that solves a more specific version of that problem. Reduces the amount of arguments in the returned function's signature, because at least one of the used-to-be-a-parameter is now an internal variable to that returned function

```js
// not currying
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }

// currying
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

add(5, 6); // 11

const add5 = makeAdder(5) // returns a FUNCTION that accepts one argument, and adds 5 to it
add5(6) // 11
```

   6. Immutability
      - Where a data structure is not changeable after creation. Strings are immutable in JavaScript. Objects & arrays are not.

|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Predictability|Performance hit, because you're copying objects all the time (especially with many tens / hundreds of thousands of objects)|
|Faster change detection for UI frameworks like React. (It's less work to tell if some property has changed, because a whole new object will be created whenever a property changes, and so the framework can do a computationally cheap referential identity check to see it it needs to update the UI (instead of a computationally expensive recursive check)|Memory overhead (because of all the object copies|
|Concurrency - more scalable code, because you can run multiple functions in parallel (because they're not relying on external state to be a certain way, they're always creating NEW state||

There are libraries such as [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) & [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) to make handling this easier in JavaScript

3. Have you ever worked as a web developer before? / Have you ever been paid to write software?
   1. Yes

   1. personal narrative

9.  What are the responsibilities of a web developer?
    1. Building / maintaining web applications / websites
        1. front end is more concerned with presentation & user interface.
        2. back end is more concerned with storing, retrieving, & sending data to the front end.
10. How do you take into account SEO, maintainability, UX, performance, & security when you're building a web application?
    1. SEO is its own field, but web developers can be expected to know some basics (ie, avoid keyword stuffing, use something like [Yoast](https://yoast.com/) if possible)
    2. Software development is all about tradeoffs - maintainability, UX, performance, & security are all affected by decisions you make regarding those tradeoffs, ie:
        1. Maintainability - are you incurring technical debt by doing something a "fast" way instead of a cleaner, more best-practice aligned way?
        2. UX - it might be harder for you to code it a certain way, but perhaps that leads to a better UX
        3. Performance - there are established patterns of more & less efficient ways to accomplish things - ie, don't load a 2000 x 2000px image if all you're displaying is a thumbnail
        4. Security - same as above with the patterns, ie, don't submit email & passwords to a server as query strings, they should go in the body of HTTPS POST requests
11. Describe your workflow when you create a web page or web app?
    1. Ideally, you want to start from a user story, identify key points of the UX, create a mockup of the design, get stakeholder feedback, build out a prototype, get stakeholder feedback again, add tests (or tests first if doing TDD), then add features as needed
12. Tell me about a project that you're particularly proud of. What did you do that worked out well?
13. What steps do you take to balance demanding client requirements?
    1. The biggest thing is setting realistic expectations upfront. ie, good-cheap-fast. You get 2 out of the 3. If the client insists on all three, you work with them to discover underpinnings / efficiencies that enable you to adjust that triangle.
14. How are you keeping up with the latest developments in web development?
    1. building side projects with new technologies
    2. medium / dev.to / etc ... articles
    3. YouTube channels / courses from prominent engineers

# Computer Science Fundamentals

1. Describe each data structure.
   1. Stacks
      1. Often visualized as a real world stack (ie, a stack of plates), whereby each new element is added to the top. Uses Last In First Out (LIFO) access order, which means the element added LAST is now the FIRST element that will get removed.
      2. Examples
         1. Call stacks
         2. Your browsing history, ie - what you access with the back button
   2. Queues
      1. Often visualized as a real world queue (ie, a checkout queue). Uses First In First Out (FIFO) access order, which means the elements are accessed in the order they were added.
      2. Examples
         1.  Keyboard buffer
         2.  Customer service ticketing systems

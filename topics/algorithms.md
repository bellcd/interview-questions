# Algorithms

1. What's the difference between an algorithm & a heuristic (in computer science)?
   1. An algorithm will always produce a correct answer, regardless of how long it would take.
   2. A heuristic usually produces an answer that's sufficient, but there's no guarantee the result will be correct 100% of the time (ie, for every set of inputs)

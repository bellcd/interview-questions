# Project Management

1. Agile VS Waterfall
    - Waterfall
      - Linear, sequential process flow
      - Scope is know, determined right at the beginning
      - Cost / timeline / deliverables flow from scope
      - Changes to scope go through formal change control, almost certainly cause changes to cost / timeline / deliverables ... too many changes can cause it-would-be-better-to-do-a-new-project
      - well suited for tangible, long term things (ie, **when the scope isn't likely to change**)
    - Agile
      - Originally envisioned as a solution to the downsides of waterfall in software development
        - ie, there were better solutions from competitors coming out 0.5 / 1yr into SDLCs ...
      - Change is expected & embraced - don't pre plan too far out into the future
      - Simple project design that becomes more clear throughout the project
      - Uses short iterations (Sprints ~30 days or less) to produce deliverables with feedback (from customer / stakeholder) after each Sprint
      - Incremental process, with customer feedback at each step, instead of all-at-the-end (like in Waterfall)
      - **well suited for knowledge work**
      - Can be challenging for inexperience people to know if they're building the "right-thing-right"
        - ie, when you have to make Waterfall type decisions in an agile process, ex how to handle state, which front end framework, which database, etc ... Each have their own tradeoffs that depend heavily on what the client requirements are (scope) ... if scope changes, what's "best" would change ...

|   |Waterfall|Agile  |
|---|---------|-------|
|Scope (picture of final product)|Clear at the beginning|NOT clear at the beginning|
|Quality VS Speed|Quality|Speed|
|Changes|Formal process for changes|Changes expected|

2. How would you handle someone who approaches you with a project management triangle? (price, speed, cost)

3. You're leading a team that's behind on a deliverable. How do you motivate them to get it done?

# Interview Questions

A collection of interview questions I've been asked, to help you better prepare for software development interviews - specifically full stack JavaScript Software Engineer interviews.

## FAQ

- Can I share / link this with _____?
  - Absolutely!
- I see something that's inaccurate / misleading / incomplete / etc...
  - Super! That means I get to learn something new. Submit a PR, please.
  - Also, this is very much a work-in-progress, so it might get addressed soon
- I'm excited! I'm going to read / re-read all of this info until I have it all memorized!
  - Maybe don't do that. It's probably counter-productive to actual learning. Try [generating the answers yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8&vl=en), then [doing simple recall](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2016/06/learning-memory)
- There's too much here!
  - Yes, it's a lot. What works for me is
    - concentrating on a *small chunk* of knowledge
    - [building something that requires me to use that chunk](https://bellcd.github.io/)
    - repeat (see above about recall)
- I have a suggestion / comment / concern / etc...
